3-MINUTEN PITCH – “SMART BATTERY CONTAINER”
“Imagine one smart container that cuts costs, boosts recycling, and rewards citizens — starting with something as small as a battery.
Every day, we use batteries — in our remotes, toys, and everyday devices. And when they’re empty, we throw them away without thinking twice. But here’s the problem: thousands of used batteries end up in regular household waste every month. They leak harmful chemicals into the environment, are dangerous for waste processors, and increase the overall cost of waste treatment for municipalities.
At the same time, most people actually want to recycle — but the system doesn’t always make it easy or rewarding. We saw a clear gap: how can we make recycling small items like batteries simple, traceable, and motivating for citizens — while also saving municipalities money?
That’s where our idea comes in. We designed a smart recycling container — inspired by the underground waste containers already used in many cities — but built specifically for collecting batteries. The container is equipped with an NFC reader, allowing residents to open it with a quick tap of their phone or a city-issued card.
Each time someone recycles their used batteries, the system automatically registers their contribution. This data is securely shared with the municipality, enabling reward-based waste management. Citizens who recycle responsibly can earn discounts or credits that reduce their monthly waste disposal fees — a direct, positive incentive for sustainable behavior.
For municipalities, the benefits are clear: cleaner waste streams, lower processing costs, and real-time insight into recycling patterns. And for citizens, recycling finally becomes personal — and worthwhile.
The technology behind it is simple, scalable, and integrates with existing underground systems. The container is durable, easy to maintain, and designed for visibility — reminding people that small actions can make a big impact.
Together, we can turn battery waste from a hidden hazard into a visible opportunity — empowering communities to take charge of their waste and their future.
So let’s not just throw batteries away  “Invest in a system that pays off — for citizens, for cities, and for the planet.”🔋
